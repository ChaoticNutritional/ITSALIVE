## About

On each playthrough, the player will be given a set of tasks randomly selected from a list of all possible tasks. These tasks are created using a task system that I developed for this project allowing future development to make use of this task system for more complex tasks.

"It's ALIVE!" showcases what I've learned during my time at NYU Tandon School of Engineering's XR Development Bootcamp.

I created a brief game that focuses primarily on object interaction within VR using VR controllers.
